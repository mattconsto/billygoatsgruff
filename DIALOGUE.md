# CALL

NARATE	Once upon a time, there was a little billy-goat "gruff", who longed for adventure beyond his paddock.
NARATE	That very night he had dreamed of a field, and a bridge, and a forest, and a choice. What could it mean?

# REFUSAL

NARATE	The choice was clear, the journey over. The little billy-goat hid in a corner.

# AID

NARATE	The little billy-goat ventured into the herd. Ready to approach one, in search of adventure.
	MIDDLE	What's that little goat?
		LITTLE	Last night I dreamed of a field, on a hill, with a bridge. We should find it.
			MIDDLE	Adventure you say, that sounds grand. I'll follow you billy-goat across these lands.
		LITTLE	I want to leave, I'm bored of this place.
			MIDDLE	Not right now can't you see, I'm as busy as can be!
	BIG	What's wrong pipsqueak?
		LITTLE	I dreamed of leaving this place, gaining my freedom, in a wide open space.
			BIG	Greener fields, wide open space? I'll follow you pipsqueak.
		LITTLE	Um, we should leave the paddock and enter the forest.
			BIG	Bah! That is stupid, this paddock is great. No dangers are lurking and we've plenty to eat.
	OTHER	Go away little billy-goat, can't you see I'm eating.
	ANOTHER	Hello, little billy-goat, go ahead, spit it out.
		LITTLE	Last night I dreamed of leaving this place.
			ANOTHER	We all dream of such silly things.

NARATE	Sadly for the little billy-goat his adventures were over, he couldn't open the gate without help of another.

# THRESHOLD

NARATE	And with that, the gate slams shut. The path is clear with no turning back.
NARATE	And with that, the gate is smashed. Into the forest the billy-goats go.

# BELLY

NARATE	Walking through the forest, they come to a split. Three paths to choose from, but which one is it?

# TRIALS

NARATE	Taking the left path the billy-goats see, a field of spikes, ow-ee!
NARATE	Taking the middle path the billy-goats see, a massive chasm and a bridge to be.
NARATE	Taking the right path the billy-goats see, a wall of crates tower over thee.

# GODESS

NARATE	The little billy-goats wander along, until just out of sight is the most beautiful doe.

FEMALE	Hello! I am lost and in need of some help. Lets stay a while, just by ourselves.
FEMALE	You may have heard tales of fields and trolls, but there is nothing but hardship if you continue along.
	LITTLE	I'm sorry doe, I'd love to stay. But our journey calls us, we are on our way.
	LITTLE	The journey is weary, we'd love to stay.
		NARATE	For the little billy-goats the journey was over. Content to stay in the forest forever.

# FATHER

NARATE	Around and around the billy-goats go, picking the wrong path at every turn. Will they realise? Only time can know.

# FIGHT

NARATE	At last there's the field, but what would you know, there's a big ugly troll who won't let you go.

BRIDGE	Trip, trap! trip, trap!
TROLL	Who’s that tripping over my bridge?
	LITTLE	Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; I’m going up the hill-side to make myself fat
		TROLL	Now, I’m coming to gobble you up.
		NARATE	And with that, the tiniest billy-goat was no more.
	LITTLE	Oh, no! pray don’t take me. I’m too little, that I am. Wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he’s much bigger than I.
		TROLL	Well! be off with you

BRIDGE	Trip, trap! trip, trap! trip, trap!
TROLL	Who’s THAT tripping over my bridge?
	MIDDLE	Oh! It’s the second billy-goat Gruff, and I’m going up to the hill-side to make myself fat.
		TROLL	Now, I’m coming to gobble you up.
		NARATE	And with that, the second billy-goat was no more.
	MIDDLE	Oh, no! don’t take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he’s much bigger.
		TROLL	Very well! be off with you

BRIDGE	TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!
TROLL	WHO’S THAT tramping over my bridge?
	BIG	IT’S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF
	TROLL	Now, I’m coming to gobble you up
		BIG	Well, come along! I’ve got two spears,
		BIG	I’ll poke your eyeballs out at your ears.
		BIG	I’ve got besides two curling-stones,
		BIG	And I’ll crush you to bits, body and bones.

# RETURN

NARATE	And so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns. He crushed him to bits, body and bones, tossing him out into the burn.
NARATE	The billy-goats went up to the hillside where they got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again! And if the fat hasn’t fallen off them, why they’re still fat; and so: Snip, snap, snout, This tale’s told out.

# MISC.

NARATE	As the billy-goats stood around, the day grew longer and longer. Before they knew it, the day was now over.
NARATE	Wait! How did you get out here?

LITTLE	bah
MIDDLE	Bah
BIG	BAH
